# CHRYSALIS DEPLOYMENT FIXES - COMPLETED

## CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. CSS LOADING PROBLEM - FIXED
**Issue**: No CSS was loading on the live site
**Root Cause**: Default Vite CSS instead of Tailwind CSS
**Solution**: 
- Replaced src/index.css with proper Tailwind directives
- Updated brand colors to stone (#8B7355), clay (#A0937D), green (#6B8E23)
- Added custom CSS variables for consistent theming

- Professional icons: MeditationIcon, TrophyIcon, QRIcon, SocialIcon, etc.
- Removed ALL emojis from:
  - Deployment scripts
  - Documentation files
  - Socket server logs
  - Beta test guide

### 3. BRAND CONSISTENCY - IMPLEMENTED

- Primary: #6B8E23 (Green - nature, growth)
- Secondary: #8B7355 (Stone - grounding, stability) 
- Accent: #A0937D (Clay - warmth, comfort)
- Background: #F5F5DC (Neutral beige - calm, professional)
